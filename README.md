## Challenges
No SQL databases are very confusing to me; initially, I thought it seemed easier, but I prefer the structure of SQL tables because the relationships make more sense when trying to query information. It took me a long time to even wrap my head around how to approach things.

The PUT route was the hardest of everything.

### Future Development Ideas
- Add time fields to workout entries to calculate total minutes of activity
- Combine workout plans with the same date into one collection instead of creating another collection with the same date
- Mark plans as in progress vs complete
